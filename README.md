# ABT E-Book Writer UI

This project is a GUI Python application for creating e-books using AI agents. It generates table of content, content, designs cover pages for the book and each chapters, and exports into separate and merged MD and PDF files.

**Being a non-programmer, I used [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and gpt-4o to produce this script.**


## Features

- Generate e-books with table of contents, chapters and images using AI(OpenAI).
- Review and edit the Table of Contents.
- Edit the final content through simple Markdown editor.
- Save the final content as a Markdown file. Exporting PDF is not supported yet.
